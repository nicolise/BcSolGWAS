how does crop domestication affect quantitative 
interactions with generalist pathogens?
how does this interact with the genetics in the pathogen?

INTRO
- plant and pathogen contribute to disease
- depends on pathogen host range
- much known about specialist qual-R

- less known about generalist quant-R
- evade qual-R by host shifts
- what is the polygenic basis of interaction?

- domestication affects resistance to specialists
- low resistance, sensitivity
- domestication genetic bottleneck
- how does domestication affect resistance to generalists?

- botrytis cinerea is a generalist with quantitative virulence
- botrytis is genetically diverse

- tomato x b cinerea show quant-R
- tomato a model in resistance and physiology

- study structure
