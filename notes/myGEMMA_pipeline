pipeline note:
#1. run B01_TABtoPEDnMAP.R
#2. copy plink to GEMMA_files
#3. in command prompt: cd to GEMMA_files
#4. RUN ./plink --noweb --file B_01_PLINK/dpbinMAF20NA10 --maf 0.2 --make-bed --out binMAF20NA10
#5. run B01_FAMaddPhenos.R to add actual DWS phenotypes
#6. cd to GEMMA_files
#7. bash DWS_GEMMA_run.sh to run GEMMA linear model without relatedness matrix
#8. calculate relatedness matrix:
cd to GEMMA_files
./gemma -bfile [prefix] -gk [num] -o [prefix]
~/gemma/bin/gemma -bfile B_01_PLINK/binMAF20NA10 -gk 1 -o binMAF20NA10_kmatrix1
~/gemma/bin/gemma -bfile B_01_PLINK/binMAF20NA10 -gk 2 -o binMAF20NA10_kmatrix2

gk 1 centered "better for lower organisms"
gk 2 standardized "better if low MAF SNPs have larger effects"

“-gk 1” calculates
the centered relatedness matrix while “-gk 2” calculates the standardized relatedness matrix;
Which of the two relatedness matrix to choose will largely depend on the underlying genetic
architecture of the given trait. Specifically, if SNPs with lower minor allele frequency tend to
have larger effects (which is inversely proportional to its genotype variance), then the standardized
genotype matrix is preferred. If the SNP effect size does not depend on its minor allele frequency,
then the centered genotype matrix is preferred. In our previous experience based on a limited
examples, we typically find the centered genotype matrix provides better control for population
structure in lower organisms, and the two matrices seem to perform similarly in humans.
 going to try BOTH??
prefix.sXX.txt contains a n × n matrix of estimated relatedness
matrix.

#9. eigen decomposition of the relatedness matrix, cause why not?
./gemma -bfile [prefix] -k [filename] -eigen -o [prefix]
~/gemma/bin/gemma -bfile B_01_PLINK/binMAF20NA10 -k output/binMAF20NA10_kmatrix1.cXX.txt -eigen -o binMAF20NA10_kmat1Eigen
~/gemma/bin/gemma -bfile B_01_PLINK/binMAF20NA10 -k output/binMAF20NA10_kmatrix2.sXX.txt -eigen -o binMAF20NA10_kmat2Eigen

“-k [filename]”
specifies the relatedness matrix file name

#10. run GEMMA linear mixed model with relatedness matrix
./gemma -bfile [prefix] -k [filename] -lmm [num] -o [prefix]
run script: bash DWS_GEMMA_kmatrix_run.sh
#11. bring back into R
