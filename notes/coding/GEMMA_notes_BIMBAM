Caryn notes on GEMMA - BIMBAM option

In the shell files, the lines that are the most relevant to you are the converting VCF to bimbam (module_pipeline1.sh line 95), and then using GEMMA to make a relatedness matrix (module_pipeline2.sh, line 60) and running GEMMA (module_pipeline2.sh, line 62). In module_pipeline2.sh, the 'awk' commands are subsetting my phenotype file into columns for one phenotype.

About pyVCF. It looks like you can install it using pip, which should be easy: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23066322/how-does-one-install-python-modules

The online manual doesn't really tell you how to install it: https://pyvcf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INTRO.html

Either way, install and try to run the vcf_to_bimbam.py on a small subset of your VCF and see what happens. If it is spitting out something that doesn't make any sense I would love to know :) We can put it up on git and fiddle with it.

Thinking about it, the vcf_to_bimbam.py is written with diploids in mind... In order for it to work, we may need to change it, but not dramatically. I think we'd have to change the genoDict, line 19, to work for haploid input.

BIMBAM is better for imputation of missing genotypes

This is not trivial to convert to vcf: https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf

Genotypes should be for bi-allelic SNPs, all on the same chromosome. The number on the first line
indicates the number of individuals; the number in the second line indicates the number of SNPs.
Optionally, the third row can contain individual ID: this line should begin with the string IND, with
subsequent strings indicating the identifier for each individual in turn. Subsequent rows contain
the genotype data for each SNP, with one row per SNP. In each row the first column gives the
SNP ID (which can be any string, but might typically be an rs number), and subsequent columns
give the genotypes for each individual in turn. Genotypes must be coded in ACGT while missing
genotypes can be indicated by NN or ??.
Note that plink can convert genotype files from plink format to bimbam format. The option is
--recode-bimbam.

3.6 Phenotype file format
In the phenotype input file, each line is a number indicating the phenotype value for each individual
in turn, in the same order as in the Genotype file. Missing phenotypes should be denoted as NA.
The number of lines should be equal to the number of individuals in genotype file (N), otherwise
the program will either throw away the values after N or append “NA” at the end to observe N
values. In either case, a warning will be printed.
Example Phenotype file with 5 individuals:
1.2
NA
2.7
-0.2
3.3

3.7 Multiple phenotype file format
One can include multiple phenotype in a phenotype file, with each column corresponds to one
phenotype, and each row corresponds to an individual. This feature comes handy for microarray
expression data when there are many phenotypes. This multiple phenotype feature is only acceptable
for single SNP Bayes factor calculations. For this to work, users use -f option to specify the
number of phenotypes. Example Phenotype file with 5 individuals each with 3 phenotypes:

1.2 -0.3 -1.5
NA 1.5 0.3
2.7 1.1 NA
-0.2 -0.7 0.8
3.3 2.4 2.1

Note, however, one can not mix the quantitative phenotypes with binary phenotypes in a single file
unless one wants to treat binary phenotype as quantitative.

3.8 SNP location file format
The file contains two, or three, columns, with the first column being the SNP name, and the second
column being its physical location. The optional but highly recommended third column should
contain chromosome number of the SNPs. Note, it is OK if the rows are not ordered according to
position, but the file must contain all the SNPs in the genotype files. If the genotype files contain
SNPs across different chromosome, bimbam will sort SNPs based on its chromosome and position.

Example file:
rs1, 1200, 1
rs2, 1000, 1
rs3, 3320, 1
rs4, 5430, 1

Note: This file is strictly needed only if the order of the SNPs in the genotype file is not the same as
the order of their physical locations along the chromosome, or if multiple genotype and phenotype
files are used (see below).
